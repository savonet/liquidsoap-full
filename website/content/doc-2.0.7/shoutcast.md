Streaming to Shoutcast
======================
Although Liquidsoap is primarily aimed at streaming to Icecast servers (that provide 
much more features than Shoutcast), it is also able to stream to Shoutcast.

Shoutcast output
----------------
Shoutcast server accept streams encoded with the MP3 or AAC/AAC+ codec. You to compile Liquidsoap with 
`lame` support, so it can encode in MP3. Liquidsoap also has support for AAC+ encoding
using FDK-AAC or using an [external encoder](external_encoders.html). The recommended format is MP3.

Shoutcast output are done using the `output.shoutcast` operator with the appropriate parameters.
An example is:
```liquidsoap
source = single("audiofile.ogg")

output.shoutcast(%mp3, host="shoutcast.example.org",
                     port=8000, password="changeme",
                     source)
```

As usual, `liquidsoap -h output.shoutcast` gives you the full list of options for this operator.

Shoutcast as relay
------------------
A side note for those of you who feel they ``need'' to use Shoutcast for non-technical reasons (such as their stream 
directory service...): you can still benefit from Icecast's power by streaming to an Icecast server, and then relaying 
it through a shoutcast server.

In order to do that, you have to alias the root mountpoint ("`/`") to your MP3 mountpoint in your icecast server 
configuration, like this:
```
<alias source="/" dest="/mystream.mp3" />
```

Be careful that icecast often aliases the status page (`/status.xsl`) with the `/`. In this case, comment 
out the status page alias before inserting yours.
