# A simple video script

The other day, I wanted to prepare some videos of my favorite reggae and soul
tunes for uploading them to YouTube.
My goal was very simple: prepare a video with the music,
and a static image.

After briefly digging for a simple software to do that,
which I could not find, I said ``hey, why not doing it with liquidsoap''?
Well, that is fairly easy!

Here is the code:

```{.liquidsoap include="video-static.liq"}

```
