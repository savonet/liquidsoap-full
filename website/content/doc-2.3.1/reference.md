# Liquidsoap scripting language reference

The **Source / ...** categories contain all functions that return sources.
The **Input** functions are those which build elementary sources
(playing files, synthesizing sound, etc.).
The **Output** functions are those which take a source and register it
for being streamed to the outside (file, soundcard, audio server, etc.).
The **Visualization** functions are experimental ones that let you
visualize in real-time some aspects of the audio stream.
The **Sound Processing** functions are those which basically work on the source
as a continuous audio stream. They would typically be mixers of streams,
audio effects or analysis.
Finally, **Track Processing** functions are basically all
others, often having a behaviour that depends on or affects the extra
information that liquidsoap puts in streams: track limits and metadata.

### `harbor.http.register`

Register a HTTP handler on the harbor. The handler function receives as argument the full requested information and returns the answer sent to the client, including HTTP headers. This function registers exact path matches, i.e. `"/users"`, `"/index.hml"` as well as fragment matches, i.e. `"/user/:id"`, `"/users/:id/collabs/:cid"`, etc. If you need more advanced matching, use `harbor.http.register.regexp` to match regular expressions. Paths are resolved in the order they are declared and can override default harbor paths such as metadata handlers. The handler receives the request details as a record and a response handler. Matched fragments are reported as part of the response `query` parameter. The response handler can be used to fill up details about the http response, which will be converted into a plain HTTP response string after the handler returns.

 ?every : {float}?, (() -> unit)) -> unit
```

Arguments:

- `fast` (of type `bool`, which defaults to `true`): Whether the thread is supposed to return quickly or not. Typically, blocking tasks (e.g. fetching data over the internet) should not be considered to be fast.

- `(unlabeled)` (of type `() -> unit`): Function to execute.

```

Arguments:

- `fast` (of type `bool`, which defaults to `true`): Whether the thread is supposed to return quickly or not. Typically, blocking tasks (e.g. fetching data over the internet) should not be considered to be fast. When set to `false` its priority will be lowered below that of request resolutions and fast timeouts. This is only effective if you set a dedicated queue for fast tasks, see the "scheduler" settings for more details.
- `delay` (of type `float`, which defaults to `0.0`): Delay (in sec.) after which the thread should be launched.

    trace : [
             {
               cstart : int,
               cstop : int,
               filename : string,

- `(unlabeled)` (of type `() -> float`): Function to execute recurrently. The returned value is the delay (in sec.) in which the function should be run again (it won't be run if the value is strictly negative).

### `normalize`

Normalization the volume of a stream (this is also called _automatic gain control_).

If possible, consider using some track-based normalization techniques such as those based on ReplayGain. The implementation of Liquidsoap < 2.0 was renamed to `normalize.old`.

Type:

- `check_next` (of type `((request) -> bool)?`, which defaults to `null`): Function used to filter next tracks. A candidate track is only validated if the function returns true on it. The function is called before resolution, hence metadata will only be available for requests corresponding to local files. This is typically used to avoid repetitions, but be careful: if the function rejects all attempts, the playlist will enter into a consuming loop and stop playing anything.
- `prefetch` (of type `int?`, which defaults to `null`): How many requests should be queued in advance.
- `loop` (of type `bool`, which defaults to `true`): Loop on the playlist.
- `mode` (of type `string`, which defaults to `"normal"`): Play the files in the playlist either in the order ("normal" mode), or shuffle the playlist each time it is loaded, and play it in this order for a whole round ("randomize" mode), or pick a random file in the playlist each time ("random" mode).

- `max_fail` (of type `int`, which defaults to `10`): When this number of requests fail to resolve, the whole playlists is considered as failed and `on_fail` is called.
- `on_fail` (of type `(() -> [string])?`, which defaults to `null`): Function executed when too many requests failed and returning the contents of a fixed playlist.

Return a quoted command line, suitable for use as an argument to `process.run`.

The optional arguments `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr` are file names used to redirect the standard input, the standard output, or the standard error of the command.

If `stdin=f` is given, a redirection `< f` is performed and the standard input of the command reads from file `f`.

If `stdout=f` is given, a redirection `> f` is performed and the standard output of the command is written to file `f`.

If `stderr=f` is given, a redirection `2> f` is performed and the standard error of the command is written to file `f`.
