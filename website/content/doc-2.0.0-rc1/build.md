# Liquidsoap 2.0.0

## Forewords

Installing liquidsoap can be a difficult task. The software relies on a up-to date
`OCaml` compiler, as well as a bunch of `OCaml` modules and, for most of them, corresponding
C library dependencies.

Our recommended way of installing liquidsoap is via [opam](http://opam.ocaml.org/). `opam` can take
care of install the correct `OCaml` compiler, optional and required dependencies as well as system-specific
package dependencies.

The `opam` method is described in details in the [documentation](doc/content/install.md).
We recommend that any interested user head over to this link to install the software via `opam`.

The following of this document describes how to install the software via its `configure` script and is
intended either for system administrators or package maintainers.

## Dependencies

Below is a list of dependencies, mostly OCaml libraries. Optional libraries
provide extra features. They need to be detected by the `configure` script.

Most of the libraries are developed by the Savonet project and, in addition to
being available through traditional distribution channels, are bundled in the
[liquidsoap-&lt;version&gt;-full.tar.bz2](https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap/releases)
tarballs for easier builds.

Libraries not developed by Savonet are:

- camlimages
- camomile
- gd4o
- ocaml-pcre
- ocaml-magic
- tsdl / tsdl-ttf / tsdl-image
- yojson

## Installing via configure

The build processus starts with by invoking the `configure` script:

```
% ./configure
```

If you want a complete installation of liquidsoap, enabling a production use of
liquidsoap as a daemon, you should pass `--with-user=<login>` and
`--with-group=<group>` options to indicate which user/group you have created for
liquidsoap.

Then, build the software:

```
% make
```

You can also generate the documentation for liquidsoap:

```
% make doc
```

It will generate the HTML documentation, including a version of the scripting
API reference corresponding to your configuration.

Then, you may proceed to the installation. You may need to be root for that.

```
% make install
```

This will not install files such as `/var/log/liquidsoap` unless you have provided
a user/group under which liquidsoap should be ran. This behavior can be
overridden by passing `INSTALL_DAEMON="yes"` (useful for preparing binary
packages).


If you need to run liquidsoap as a daemon, you can then have a look at
[liquidsoap-daemon](https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap-daemon).
