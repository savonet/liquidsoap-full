Using in production
===================
The full installation of liquidsoap will typically install
`/etc/liquidsoap`, `/etc/init.d/liquidsoap` and `/var/log/liquidsoap`.
All these are meant for a particular usage of liquidsoap
when running a stable radio.

Your production `.liq` files should go in `/etc/liquidsoap`.
You'll then start/stop them using the init script, *e.g.*
`/etc/init.d/liquidsoap start`.
Your scripts don't need to have the `#!` line,
and liquidsoap will automatically be ran on daemon mode (`-d` option) for them.

You should not override the `log.file.path` setting because a
logrotate configuration is also installed so that log files
in the standard directory are truncated and compressed if they grow too big.

It is not very convenient to detect errors when using the init script.
We advise users to check their scripts after modification (use
```
liquidsoap --check /etc/liquidsoap/script.liq```
)
before effectively restarting the daemon.
