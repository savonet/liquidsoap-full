Developping Flows
=================
[Flows](flows.html) is handled on the [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) platform.

Getting started
---------------
First steps to get started.

* Create an account on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
* Install the [Heroku utilities](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/).
* Ask a Liquidsoap administrator to give you access to the repositories.

The repositories of the main components are organized as follows.

* `savonet-flows` is the python handler to submit metadata:
  * the associated [github repository](https://github.com/savonet/flows-submit)
  * the Heroku repository is `git@heroku.com:savonet-liquidsoap.git`
* `savonet-flows-socket` is the node application to serve the webpage and client stuff.
  * the associated [github repository](https://github.com/savonet/flows-push)
  * the [test Heroku webpage](http://savonet-flows-socket.herokuapp.com/) is updated by pushing on `git@heroku.com:savonet-flows-socket-next.git`
  * the [prod Heroku webpage](http://savonet-flows-socket.herokuapp.com/) is updated by pushing on `git@heroku.com:savonet-flows-socket.git`

Some more experimental repositories include:

* a [command-line client](https://github.com/savonet/flows-client)

Useful commands
---------------
Getting the environment variables:

```
heroku config -s --app savonet-flows
