This release provides liquidsoap assets before they are published as a new versioned release.

You can use it to install the latest stable code before it is published and test/prepare your production environment for it.

Rolling releases can also be useful for us to quickly detect and report bugs before the final published release!

Assets listed in this release will never be modified or deleted. Feel free to use them for packaging or distribution purposes.
