Liquidsoap scripting language reference
=======================================

The **Source / ...** categories contain all functions that return sources.
The **Input** functions are those which build elementary sources
(playing files, synthesizing sound, etc.).
The **Output** functions are those which take a source and register it
for being streamed to the outside (file, soundcard, audio server, etc.).
The **Visualization** functions are experimental ones that let you
visualize in real-time some aspects of the audio stream.
The **Sound Processing** functions are those which basically work on the source
as a continuous audio stream. They would typically be mixers of streams,
audio effects or analysis.
Finally, **Track Processing** functions are basically all
others, often having a behaviour that depends on or affects the extra
information that liquidsoap puts in streams: track limits and metadata.

### `cross`

Cross operator, allowing the composition of the _n_ last seconds of a track with the beginning of the next track, using a transition function depending on the relative power of the signal before and after the end of track.

Type:

```
(?id : string?, ?active : bool, ?conservative : bool,
 ?duration : {float}, ?minimum : float,
 ?override_duration : string, ?width : float,
 ((
   {
     db_level : float,
     metadata : [string * string],
     source : source(audio=pcm('a),
     video='b,
     midi='c)
   }, 
   {
     db_level : float,
     metadata : [string * string],
     source : source(audio=pcm('a),
     video='b,
     midi='c)
   }) -> source(audio=pcm('a), video='b, midi='c)),

```

Arguments:

- `id` (of type `string?`, which defaults to `null`): Force the value of the source ID.
- `active` (of type `bool`, which defaults to `false`): The active behavior is to keep ticking the child's clock when the operator is not streaming. Otherwise the child's clock is strictly based on what is streamed off the child source, which results in time-dependent active sources to be frozen when that source is stopped.
- `conservative` (of type `bool`, which defaults to `true`): Do not trust remaining time estimations, always buffering data in advance. This avoids being tricked by skips, either manual or caused by blank.skip().
- `duration` (of type `{float}`, which defaults to `5.`): Duration (in seconds) of buffered data from each track that is used to compute the transition between tracks.
- `minimum` (of type `float`, which defaults to `-1.`): Minimum duration (in sec.) for a cross: If the track ends without any warning (e.g. in case of skip) there may not be enough data for a decent composition. Set to 0. to avoid having transitions after skips, or more to avoid transitions on short tracks. With a negative default, transitions always occur.
- `override_duration` (of type `string`, which defaults to `"liq_cross_duration"`): Metadata field which, if present and containing a float, overrides the 'duration' parameter for current track.
- `width` (of type `float`, which defaults to `2.`): Width of the power computation window.

 {
   db_level : float,
   metadata : [string * string],
   source : source(audio=pcm('a),

 }, 
 {
   db_level : float,
   metadata : [string * string],
   source : source(audio=pcm('a),
   video='b,
   midi='c)
 }) -> source(audio=pcm('a), video='b, midi='c)`): Transition function, composing from the end of a track and the next track. The sources corresponding to the two tracks are decorated with fields indicating the power of the signal before and after the transition (`power`), and the metadata (`metadata`).

### `normalize.old`

Normalize the signal. Dynamic normalization of the signal is sometimes the only option, and can make a listening experience much nicer. However, its dynamic aspect implies some limitations which can go as far as creating saturation in some extreme cases. If possible, consider using some track-based normalization techniques such as those based on replay gain. See the documentation for more details. This is the implementation provided in Liquidsoap < 2.0. A new, better and more customizable one is now given in `normalize`.

- `check_next` (of type `((request) -> bool)?`, which defaults to `null`): Function used to filter next tracks. A candidate track is only validated if the function returns true on it. The function is called before resolution, hence metadata will only be available for requests corresponding to local files. This is typically used to avoid repetitions, but be careful: if the function rejects all attempts, the playlist will enter into a consuming loop and stop playing anything.

### `normalize`

Normalization the volume of a stream (this is also called _automatic gain control_).

If possible, consider using some track-based normalization techniques such as those based on ReplayGain. The implementation of Liquidsoap < 2.0 was renamed to `normalize.old`.

- `dst` (of type `bool`): Daylight time savings in effect.
- `hour` (of type `int`): Hours.
- `min` (of type `int`): Minutes.
- `month` (of type `int`): Month of year.
- `sec` (of type `int`): Seconds.

- `year_day` (of type `int`): Day of year.

### `time.up`

Current time, in seconds, since the script has started.

Type:

```
() -> float
```

Arguments:


### `time.utc`

Convert a time in seconds into a date in the UTC time zone (current time is used if no argument is provided). Fields meaning same as POSIX's `tm struct`. In particular, "year" is: year - 1900, i.e. 117 for 2017!

Type:

```
(?float?) -> unit
```

Arguments:

- `(unlabeled)` (of type `float?`, which defaults to `null`)

Methods:

- `day` (of type `int`): Day of month.
- `dst` (of type `bool`): Daylight time savings in effect.
- `hour` (of type `int`): Hours.
- `min` (of type `int`): Minutes.
- `month` (of type `int`): Month of year.
- `sec` (of type `int`): Seconds.
- `week_day` (of type `int`): Day of week (Sunday is 0 or 7, Saturday is 6).
- `year` (of type `int`): Year.
- `year_day` (of type `int`): Day of year.

## Visualization

### `video.vumeter`

VU meter: display the audio volume (RMS in dB). This adds a video track to the source.

Type:

```
(?rms_min : float, ?rms_max : float, ?window : float,
 ?color : int, ?persistence : float,
 source(audio=pcm('a), video=none, midi='b)) ->
source(audio=pcm('a), video=internal('c), midi='b)
```

Arguments:

- `rms_min` (of type `float`, which defaults to `-35.`): Minimal volume (dB).
- `rms_max` (of type `float`, which defaults to `0.`): Maximal volume (dB).
- `window` (of type `float`, which defaults to `0.1`): Duration in seconds of volume computation.
- `color` (of type `int`, which defaults to `16711680`): Color of the display (0xRRGGBB).
- `persistence` (of type `float`, which defaults to `0.`): Persistence of the display (s).
- `(unlabeled)` (of type `source(audio=pcm('a), video=none, midi='b)`)

Methods:

- `duration` (of type `() -> float`): Estimation of the duration of the current track.
- `elapsed` (of type `() -> float`): Elapsed time in the current track.
- `fallible` (of type `bool`): Indicate if a source may fail, i.e. may not be ready to stream.
- `id` (of type `() -> string`): Identifier of the source.
- `is_active` (of type `() -> bool`): `true` if the source is active, i.e. it is continuously animated by its own clock whenever it is ready. Typically, `true` for outputs and sources such as `input.http`.
- `is_ready` (of type `() -> bool`): Indicate if a source is ready to stream. This does not mean that the source is currently streaming, just that its resources are all properly initialized.
- `is_up` (of type `() -> bool`): Indicate that the source can be asked to produce some data at any time. This is `true` when the source is currently being used or if it could be used at any time, typically inside a `switch` or `fallback`.
- `last_metadata` (of type `() -> [string * string]?`): Return the last metadata from the source.
- `log` (of type `{level : (() -> int?).{set : (int) -> unit}}`): Get or set the source's log level, from `1` to `5`.
- `on_get_ready` (of type `((() -> unit)) -> unit`): Register a function to be called after the source is asked to get ready. This is when, for instance, the source's final ID is set.
- `on_leave` (of type `((() -> unit)) -> unit`): Register a function to be called when source is not used anymore by another source.
- `on_metadata` (of type `((([string * string]) -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler on metadata packets.
- `on_shutdown` (of type `((() -> unit)) -> unit`): Register a function to be called when source shuts down.
- `on_track` (of type `((([string * string]) -> unit)) -> unit`): Call a given handler on new tracks.
- `remaining` (of type `() -> float`): Estimation of remaining time in the current track.
- `seek` (of type `(float) -> float`): Seek forward, in seconds (returns the amount of time effectively seeked).
- `self_sync` (of type `() -> bool`): Is the source currently controling its own real-time loop.
- `skip` (of type `() -> unit`): Skip to the next track.
- `time` (of type `() -> float`): Get a source's time, based on its assigned clock.
