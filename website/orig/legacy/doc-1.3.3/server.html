    <h1>Liquidsoap 1.3.3 : Interaction with the server</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <h3>Interaction with the server</h3>
<p>
Liquidsoap starts with one or several scripts as its configuration, and then
streams forever if everything goes well. Once started, you can still interact
with it by means of the <em>server</em>. The server allows you to run commands. Some
are general and always available, some belong to a specific operator. For
example the <code>request.queue()</code> instances register commands to enqueue new
requests, the outputs register commands to start or stop the outputting, display
the last ten metadata chunks, etc.
</p>
<p>
The protocol of the server is a simple human-readable one. Currently it does not
have any kind of authentication and permissions. It is currently available via
two media: TCP and Unix sockets. The TCP socket provides a simple telnet-like
interface, available only on the local host by default. The Unix socket
interface (<em>cf.</em> the <code>server.socket</code> setting) is through some sort of virtual
file. This is more constraining, which allows one to restrict the use of the
socket to some priviledged users.
</p>
<p>
You can find more details on how to configure the server in the
<a href="help.html#settings">documentation</a> of the settings key <code>server</code>, in particular
<code>server.telnet</code> for the TCP interface and <code>server.socket</code> for the Unix
interface. Liquidsoap also embeds some <a href="help.html#server">documentation</a> about
the available server commands.
</p>
<p>
Now, we shall simply enable the Telnet interface to the server, by setting
<code>set("server.telnet",true)</code> or simply passing the <code>-t</code> option on the
command-line. In a <a href="complete_case.html">complete case analysis</a> we set up a
<code>request.queue()</code> instance to play user requests. It had the identifier
<code>"queue"</code>. We are now going to interact via the server to push requests into
that queue:
</p>
<pre class="syntax ">dbaelde@selassie:~$ telnet localhost 1234
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.localdomain.
Escape character is '^]'.
queue.push /path/to/some/file.ogg
5
END
request.metadata 5
[...]
END
queue.push http://remote/audio.ogg
6
END
request.trace 6
[...see if the download started/succeeded...]
END
exit
</pre>
<p>
Of course, the server isn't very user-friendly. But it is easy to write scripts
to interact with Liquidsoap in that way, to implement a website or an IRC
interface to your radio. However, this sort of tool is often bound to a specific
usage, so we have not released any of ours. Feel free to <a href="mailto:savonet-users@lists.sf.net">ask the
community</a> about code that you could re-use.
</p>
<h4>Interactive variables</h4>
<p>
Sometimes it is useful to control a variable using telnet. A simple way to
achive this is to use the <code>interactive.float</code> function. For instance, in order
to dynamically the volume of a source:
</p>
<pre class="syntax liq"># Register a telnet variable named volume with 1 as initial value
v = interactive.float("volume", 1.)

# Change the volume accordingly
source = amplify(v, source)
</pre>
<div align="right">
<a href="scripts/server_interactive_variables.liq">
<img class="grab" src="../images/grab.png" alt="Grab the code!">
</a>
</div></p>
<p>
The first line registers the variable volume on the telnet. Its value can be
changed using the telnet command
</p>
<pre class="syntax ">var.set volume = 0.5
</pre>
<p>
and it can be retrieved using
</p>
<pre class="syntax ">var.get volume
</pre>
<p>
Similarly, we can switch between two tracks using <code>interactive.bool</code> and
<code>switch</code> as follows:
</p>
<pre class="syntax liq"># Activate the telnet server
set("server.telnet",true)

# The two sources
s1 = playlist("~/Music")
s2 = sine()

# Create an interactive boolean
b = interactive.bool("button", true)

# Switch between the tracks depending on the boolean
s = switch(track_sensitive=false,[(b,s1), ({true},s2)])

# Output the result
output.pulseaudio(s)
</pre>
<div align="right">
<a href="scripts/interactive_bool.liq">
<img class="grab" src="../images/grab.png" alt="Grab the code!">
</a>
</div></p>
<p>
By default the source s1 is played. To switch to s2, you can connect on
the telnet server and type <code>var.set button = false</code>.
</p>
<h4>Securing the server</h4>
<p>
The command server provided by liquidsoap is very convenient for manipulating a
running instance of Liquidsoap. However, no authentication mechanism is
provided. The telnet server has no authentication and listens by default on the
localhost (<code>127.0.0.1</code>) network interface, which means that it is accessible to
any logged user on the machine.
</p>
<p>
Many users have expressed interest into setting up a secured access to the
command server, using for instance user and password information. While we
understand and share this need, we do not believe this is a task that lies into
Liquidsoap's scope. An authentication mechanism is not something that should be
implemented naively. Being SSH, HTTP login or any other mechanism, all these
methods have been, at some point, exposed to security issues. Thus, implementing
our own secure access would require a constant care about possible security
issues.
</p>
<p>
Rather than doing our own home-made secure acces, we believe that our users
should be able to define their own secure access to the command server, taking
advantage of a mainstream authentication mechanism, for instance HTTP or SSH
login. In order to give an example of this approach, we show here how to create
a SSH access to the command server: we create a SSH user that, when logging
through SSH, has only access to the command server.
</p>
<p>
First, we enable the unix socket for the command server in Liquidsoap:
</p>
<pre class="syntax liq">set("server.socket",true)
set("server.socket.path","/path/to/socket")
</pre>
<div align="right">
<a href="scripts/server_socket_settings.liq">
<img class="grab" src="../images/grab.png" alt="Grab the code!">
</a>
</div></p>
<p>
When started, liquidsoap will create a socket file <code>/path/to/socket</code>
that can be used to interact with the command server. For instance,
if your user has read and write rights on the socket file, you can do
</p>
<pre class="syntax ">socat /path/to/socket -
</pre>
<p>
The interface is then exactly the same has for the telnet server.
</p>
<p>
We define now a new “shell”. This shell is in fact the invokation of the socat
command. Thus, we create a <code>/usr/local/bin/liq_shell</code> file with the following
content:
</p>
<pre class="syntax ">#!/bin/sh
# We test if the file is a socket, readable and writable.
if [ -S /path/to/socket ] && [ -w /path/to/socket ] && \
   [ -r /path/to/socket ]; then
  socat /path/to/socket -
else
# If not, we exit..
  exit 1
fi
</pre>
<p>
We set this file as executable, and we add it in the list of shells in <code>/etc/shells</code>.
</p>
<p>
Now, we create a user with the <code>liq_shell</code> as its shell:
</p>
<pre class="syntax ">adduser --shell /usr/local/bin/liq_shell liq-user
</pre>
<p>
You also need to make sure that <code>liq-user</code> has read and write rights
on the socket file.
</p>
<p>
Finally, when logging through ssh with <code>liq-user</code>, we get:
</p>
<pre class="syntax ">11:27 toots@leonard % ssh liq-user@localhost
liq-user@localhost's password:
Linux leonard 2.6.32-4-amd64 #1 SMP Mon Apr 5 21:14:10 UTC 2010 x86_64

<p>
This is an example of how you can use an existing secure access to 
secure the access to liquidsoap's command server. This way, you make sure
that you are using a mainstream secure application, here SSH.
</p>
<p>
This example may be adapted similarly to use an online HTTP login 
mechanism, which is probably the most comment type of mechanism
intented for the command line server.
